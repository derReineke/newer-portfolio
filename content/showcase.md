## Websites that I've made

### Old(er) Portfolio
The first is my old(er) portfolio. It was coded completely by me, without using a static-site generator. I love the aesthetic of it, as my main coding environment when I first started was the terminal on Linux.

### Old Portfolio
This portfolio was made using Hugo, which made this site as well. I really like Hugo as it works most of the time. I like the clean feel of the theme I used for it.

### Metro aka Brutalist
By far my favorite thing that I've made so far. It was a hidden page on my original portfolio. It is done in a brutalist web design style, which I love. So clean and easy to read. I followed typography best practices with this one.

### Truslav.com
Truslav.com was made for the Glorious Union of Truslavistan to be their homepage. They had a twitter as well, and an archive. I think they may be shutting down, except maybe the twitter. I'll keep you all posted.

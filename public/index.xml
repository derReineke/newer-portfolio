      <description>Websites that I&amp;rsquo;ve made Old(er) Portfolio The first is my old(er) portfolio. It was coded completely by me, without using a static-site generator. I love the aesthetic of it, as my main coding environment when I first started was the terminal on Linux.
 Old(er) Porfolio
 Old Portfolio This portfolio was made using Hugo, which made this site as well. I really like Hugo as it works most of the time.</description>

      <description>Hello there
My name is Reineke Fuchs, for those who missed it. I am a student(still) currently working on a post-degree certificate in Cybersecurity; my Bachelors is in the Humanities. I went to grad school for a little bit for Germanic Studies, but I hated it so I dropped out. I then started teaching myself how to program in Python, as well as learned some Data Analysis. I am currently building my knowledge base in Data Science and Cybersecurity.</description>
